{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"## Why? ##\r\n\r\nI need something to allow collaborative annotation of PDF files, Cournal is\r\ntherefore heavily inspired by [Xournal](http://xournal.sf.net/) (note taking)\r\nand [Gobby](http://gobby.0x539.de/) (collaboration).\r\n\r\n## Aim ##\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is a note taking application similar\r\nto Xournal, but with networking support.\r\n\r\n### Why not extend Xournal? ###\r\n\r\nThere has been numerous discussions over many years on the Xournal mailing list\r\nand Xournal++ even had experimental networking support, but it didn't work out.\r\nSo I started Cournal, which got networking support just after PDF viewing and\r\nsimple drawing was done. Therefore it is designed with networking in mind from \r\nscratch.\r\n\r\n## Does it work yet ##\r\n\r\nYes, but you might miss some features (to change that, see next section ;-)). \r\n\r\n## How to help ##\r\n\r\nYou are very welcome to support the project!\r\n\r\nTo get into Cournal hacking, have a look at LINKS.md, which contains a list of\r\nmost things you need to know.\r\nFeel free to contact me, if questions arise or if you want to improve Cournal,\r\nbut don't know what needs work.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies ##\r\n\r\n * Python 3.x\r\n * Poppler 0.18 or newer\r\n * GObject Introspection\r\n * ZopeInterface 3.6.0 or newer\r\n * GTK+ 3.2 or newer (GTK 3.4 is strongly recommended)\r\n * Twisted for python3 (download script: download-twisted.sh)\r\n\r\n## Installation ##\r\n\r\nA proper installation is unsupported at the moment. To download twisted for\r\npython3, run\r\n    ./download-twisted.sh\r\nin Cournals base directory\r\n\r\nPatches to support system-wide installation are very welcome.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\n##### Server ######\r\n\r\n    cournal-server.py -p [portnumber]\r\n\r\n##### Client ######\r\n    \r\nStart Cournal, select \"Annotate PDF\" and then \"Connect to Server\".\r\n\r\n## File Format ##\r\n\r\nThe file format is compatible to Xournals .xoj files, but Cournal might not be\r\nable to open some .xoj files created by Xournal, because it doesn't support\r\nall features of the file format. The other way around should work though.\r\n","name":"Cournal","tagline":"Cournal is a collaborative note taking and journal application using a stylus.","google":""}
